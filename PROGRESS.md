# PROGRESS

Running log. Newest step at the bottom. Every step appends: what changed, decisions, gotchas, follow-ups.

## Step 01: monorepo bootstrap

**Environment:** Node `v22.19.0`, pnpm `12.16.1` (already installed; corepack not used). Branch `feat/monorepo-and-docs`, created from a safety commit on `master` (`265f505 chore: baseline before monorepo restructure`) because `AGENTS.md` was untracked.

**What changed**

* New root workspace: `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`apps/*`, `packages/*`, `tools/*`), root `package.json` (`motion-studio`, private, `packageManager: pnpm@12.16.1`, `engines.node >=22.12`, scripts `studio:dev`, `studio:build`, `typecheck`), new `.gitignore` (kept every old entry), `.prettierrc.json`, `.editorconfig`, this file.
* Motion Canvas project moved with `git mv` into `apps/studio`: `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/`. Git records them as renames (100% similarity); no `.tsx`, `.ts` or `.meta` byte changed. `apps/studio/vite.config.ts` and `apps/studio/tsconfig.json` are byte-identical to before (the `./src/projects/*.ts` glob is relative to the package, so it still resolves).
* `package-lock.json` and the npm `node_modules` deleted; `pnpm-lock.yaml` is now the lockfile. No `.npmrc` was needed — `@motion-canvas/ui` resolves fine through pnpm's isolated `node_modules`, so no hoisting workaround.
* `apps/studio/package.json`: name `@motion-studio/studio`, `private: true`, **no** `type` field, scripts `dev: vite`, `build: tsc --noEmit && vite build`, `typecheck: tsc --noEmit`. Versions untouched.

**Final package set of `apps/studio`**

* dependencies: `@motion-canvas/2d ^3.17.2`, `@motion-canvas/core ^3.17.2`, `@motion-canvas/ffmpeg ^1.1.0`
* devDependencies: `@motion-canvas/ui ^3.17.2`, `@motion-canvas/vite-plugin ^3.17.2`, `prettier ^3.9.10`, `typescript ^5.2.2`, `vite ^4.0.0` (resolved to `4.5.14`)

**Working project URLs (later steps depend on this)**

* Studio root: `http://localhost:9000/` → 200
* Project: `http://localhost:9000/src/projects/<slug>` → `db-indexing` and `db-transactions` both 200
* Section deep-link in dev: `http://localhost:9000/src/projects/<slug>#s=<section-number>`

**Build output (verified, then `apps/studio/dist` removed)**

```
dist/src/projects/db-transactions-ac22f8df.js   32.63 kB
dist/src/projects/db-indexing-a520dc3d.js       60.13 kB
dist/_virtual_settings-f3046a97.js             178.88 kB
```

**Decisions / gotchas**

* pnpm 12 blocks dependency build scripts and install exited `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS`. `onlyBuiltDependencies` is gone in pnpm 11+ and the `pnpm` field in `package.json` is no longer read; the fix is an `allowBuilds` map in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` for the three existing (not new) packages `@ffmpeg-installer/darwin-arm64`, `@ffprobe-installer/darwin-arm64` and `esbuild`. Without it the ffmpeg exporter and Vite's esbuild binary would not be usable.
* Deleted the old root `.prettierrc` (`tabWidth: 4`). Prettier picks `.prettierrc` over `.prettierrc.json`, so keeping it would have silently shadowed the new shared style (`prettier --find-config-path` confirmed the precedence). Formatting rules now come only from `.prettierrc.json`.
* Move `package.json` **last** in future moves: `git mv package.json apps/studio/package.json` moves whatever root manifest exists at that moment, not the original.
* `public/` was empty and untracked, so there was nothing to move and the empty directory was dropped. `src/scenes/.DS_Store` is untracked/ignored and travelled with `src/`.
* `.meta` files still match the recorded file hashes because only paths changed, but the next editor open may rewrite them — commit those separately if it happens.

**Follow-ups**

* Step 02+: add `apps/docs` (TanStack Start + Fumadocs), `packages/video-kit`, `tools/*`. `apps/docs` must not import `.tsx` from `video-kit`.
* Build asset hashes change per build; do not hardcode them anywhere.
